If you have npm installed already, `cd` into the Digit's directory and simply type:\n\n    npm install\n\nIt will add MontageJS and all the other dependencies. Then you can preview the components on your local server by going to `[path-to-digit]/overview`.\n\n## Components\n\n![digit](overview/assets/images/digit.png)\n\nThese are just a few examples, [see them all](overview).\n",
